## Welcome to the Playground

Dave Correia's projects will be listed here in various phases of developement. Links to single pages will be listed as most projects are single page apps. The pages are self contained, i.e. no external resources are required.

### Screen Size Calculator

This project was created to reveal an exact screen size despite the diagonal screen size. I am a terrible virtual keyboard typist and smaller screens only make the problem worse. Screen width determines the density of the keys and I, as I shop for a new phone, am concerned about screen width. Accordingly, an iPhone SE is NOT a consideration. I created a calculator to reveal a screen's physical size.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Davecorr/davecorr.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Davecorr/davecorr.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
