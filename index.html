        <h1>Welcome to Davecorr's Javascript Playground</h1>

        <p>Various projects under development are available for testing purposes.</p>
        <p>
            I've been trying to makes single, self contained 'app' pages requiring no external resources. Most of the projects do not use graphics and are native Javascript. Others are experiments using base64 graphic conversions, and others may use traditional external resourses.

        <h3>Screen Size Calculator</h3>
        <p>This project was created to reveal an exact screen size despite the screen's aspect. I am a terrible virtual keyboard typist and smaller screens only make the problem worse. Screen width determines the density of the keys and I, as I shop for a new phone, am concerned about screen width. Accordingly, an iPhone SE is NOT a consideration. A 6.5" screen sound awesome, unless it has a 20:9 aspect. It's still a large screen but the width is not as dramatic as would be if it had an 19: or 18:9 aspect. I created this calculator to reveal a screen's true physical size. I also included formatting for various phone aspects and tablets. No screen rotation has been considered.</p>
